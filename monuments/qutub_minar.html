                The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms
                part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by
                the Tomar Rajputs. It consists of 399 steps [3] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area
                of South Delhi, India.[4][5] It is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built
                between 1199 and 1220.[6][7][4]

                It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which was
                constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.[8] The surfaces of both are
                elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is
                fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage.[9][10][11] In
                general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they
                exist.[12]

                In recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions involving international
                relations. In September 2023, the monument was lit up in the colors of the Mexican flag to celebrate
                Mexico's 213th Independence Day, an event that was acknowledged and appreciated by the Embassy of Mexico
                in India.[13] Similarly, on October 30, the Qutub Minar was illuminated with the Turkish flag to
                commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, an occasion that received special attention
                from the Turkish Embassy in New Delhi.[14]

                The tower includes elements of traditional Islamic architecture and southwestern Asian design. Elizabeth

                the introduction of Islam in South Asia and how the region influenced the Islamic religious
                architecture.[15] These newly arrived Muslims from the Islamic West escaped the Mongol Empire and
                emigrated to India, where they constructed religious centers. The Qutb Minar serves as a central marker
                to these new Muslim communities as well as being a reminder of Islam's presence in the area.[15] The
                architecture of the minaret varies greatly from that of the typical style and design of the mosques
                constructed in the Middle East. The style of these structures is influenced by the local architecture
                such as the Indic temples. This affected the different materials, techniques, and decoration that were
                used in the construction of the Qutb Minar.[15]

                <br>
                Historically, tower minarets were uncommon in South Asian-Islamic design until the 17th century, due to
                the slow adoption of the typical Middle Eastern style in India.[15] It is also detached from the main
                mosque, showcasing how the native culture affected the design of a Middle Eastern structure.[12] The
                Qutb Minar is seen as the "earliest and best example of a fusion or synthesis of Hindu-Muslim
                traditions" according to Ved Parkash in his essay The Qutb Minar from Contemporary and Near Contemporary
                Sources.[15] Like many mosques built in South Asia during this time period, the minaret was constructed
                by Hindu laborers and craftsmen but overseen by Muslim architects.[15] This led to a construction that
                synthesized both Hindu and Islamic religious architecture. Since some of the craftsmen were Hindu and
                unfamiliar with the Quran, the inscriptions are a compilation of disarranged Quranic texts and other
                Arabic expressions.[15]

                he Qutb Minar was built over the ruins of the Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika.[7] Qutub Minar was begun
                after the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque. Drawing references from their Ghurid homeland, Qutub-ud-Din Aibak and
                Shamsu’d-Din Iltutmish constructed a minar (minaret) at the south-eastern corner of the Quwwatu’l-Islam
                between 1199 and 1503.[16]

                It is usually thought that the tower is named for Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who began it. It is also possible
                that it is named after Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki a 13th-century sufi saint, because Shamsuddin
                Iltutmish was a devotee of his.[17]

                The Minar is surrounded by several historically significant monuments of the Qutb complex.
                Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, to the north-east of the Minar was built by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak in A.D. 1199. It
                is the earliest extant - mosque built by the Delhi Sultans. It consists of a rectangular courtyard
                enclosed by cloisters, erected with the carved columns and architectural members of 27 Jain and Hindu
                temples, which were demolished by Qutub-ud-Din Aibak as recorded in his inscription on the main eastern
                entrance.[18] Later, a lofty arched screen was erected, and the mosque was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din
                Itutmish (A.D. 1210–35) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in
                Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a
                Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named
                Chandra.[18]
