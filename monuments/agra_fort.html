                The Agra Fort (Qila Agra) is a historical fort in the city of Agra, and also known as Agra's Red Fort.
                Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned at this fort. It was later renovated by the Mughal emperor Akbar from
                1565 and the present-day structure was completed in 1573. It served as the main residence of the rulers
                of the Mughal dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as
                the "Lal-Qila" or "Qila-i-Akbari".[1] Before being captured by the British, the last Indian rulers to
                have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                because of its importance during the Mughal Dynasty.[2] It is about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) northwest of
                its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled
                city. It was later renovated by Shah Jahan.

                Like the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud of Ghazni's invasion is unclear.
                However, in the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of
                capital when Sikandar Khan Lodi (1487–1517 CE) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few
                buildings in the preexisting fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (1526 CE), Mughals captured
                the fort and ruled from it. In 1530 CE, Humayun was crowned in it. The fort was given its present
                appearance during the reign of Akbar (1556–1605 CE). Later, this fort was under the rule of Jats of
                Bharatpur for 13 years.

                After the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He
                later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was
                defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun
                recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor
                to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.[3]

                Realising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in
                1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a
                ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in
                Rajasthan.[4] Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with
                sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in
                1573.[5][6]

                It was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state.
                Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah
                Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. When Aurangzeb was victorious among his all
                brothers, then he imprisoned Shah Jahan in 1658 in the same fort only.

                The fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 years. In the fort, they built the 'Ratan Singh ki
                Haveli'. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter,
                it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at
                Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next
                decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during
                the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803.[4] The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion
                of 1857 which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India and led to a century of
                direct rule in India by Britain.[4][7]

                he 380,000 m2 (94-acre) fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and
                its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with
                battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides,
                one Khizri gate opening on to the river. Two of the fort's gates are notable: the "Delhi Gate" and the
                "Lahore Gate". The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the "Amar Singh Gate," for Amar Singh
                Rathore.[4]

                The monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the
                grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance
                security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with
                intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate
                from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol ("Elephant Gate") – guarded by two
                life-sized stone elephants with their riders – added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight
                ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a
                siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to
                gather speed, however, that is prevented by this layout.[9]
