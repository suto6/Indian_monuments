                Taj Mahal is one of the famous monuments in India built with beautiful white marbles and it is located
                in the Agra city which lies on the banks of Yamuna river. The design of Taj Mahal is the combination of
                Mughal, Persian, Indian architectural styles. It is also one of the seven wonders of the world. This
                structure was built by Shahjahan in the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal

                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar
                Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to
                house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The
                tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
                and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

                Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project
                for another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6
                February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed
                to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million,
                which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).

                The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It
                employs symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is
                constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings
                in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more
                than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori,
                the emperor's court architect.

                The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Islamic art
                in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded as one
                of the best examples of Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major
                tourist attraction and attracts more than five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a
                winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.
