                The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood
                of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah
                Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1639, when he decided to shift his capital
                from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori,
                who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in the Mughal architecture under Shah
                Jahan and combines Persian palace architecture with Indian traditions.

                The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in
                1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the
                Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was
                subsequently used as a garrison.

                On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian flag above the
                Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the prime minister hoists the Indian
                tricolour flag at the fort's main gate and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts
                through the Public Address System of Indian Army Corps of Signals.

                The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red Fort Complex.[1][2]

                The name Red Fort is a translation of the Hindustani Lāl Qila (Hindi: लाल क़िला, Urdu: لال قلعہ),[3][4]
                deriving from its red sandstone walls. Lal was derived from Hindi meaning "Red" and Qalàh derived from
                Arabic word meaning "Fortress". As the residence of the imperial family, the fort was originally known
                as the "Blessed Fort" (Qila-i-Mubārak).[5][6] Agra Fort is also known as Lāl Qila.

                Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift
                his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours,[7] its design
                is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.[8][9] The fort lies
                along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls.[10] Construction began in the
                sacred Islamic month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638.[11]: 01  Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on
                6 April 1648.[12][13][14] Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to
                contain the older Salimgarh Fort.[11]: 04  The fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of
                Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid
                (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates
                to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous.[11]: 08

                seen in the background extending a couple of thousand meters.

                The administrative and fiscal structure of the Mughal dynasty declined after Aurangzeb, and the 18th
                century saw a degeneration of the palace. In 1712 Jahandar Shah became the Mughal Emperor. Within a year
                of beginning his rule, Shah was murdered and replaced by Farrukhsiyar. In 1739, Persian emperor Nadir
                Shah easily defeated the strong Mughal army of around 200,000 soldiers,[15] plundering the Red Fort,
                including the Peacock Throne. Nadir Shah returned to Persia after three months, leaving a destroyed city
                and a weakened Mughal empire to Muhammad Shah.[11]: 09  The internal weakness of the Mughal Empire made
                the Mughals only titular rulers of Delhi, and a 1752 treaty made the Marathas protectors of the throne
                at Delhi.[16][17] The 1758 Maratha victory at Sirhind aided by the Sikhs and successive defeat at
                Panipat[18] placed them in further conflict with Ahmad Shah Durrani.[19][20]

                In 1760, the Marathas removed and melted the silver ceiling of the Diwan-i-Khas to raise funds for the
                defence of Delhi from the armies of Ahmed Shah Durrani.[21][22] In 1761, after the Marathas lost the
                third battle of Panipat, Delhi was raided by Ahmed Shah Durrani. Ten years later, the Marathas, acting
                on the behest of the exiled Emperor Shah Alam II, recaptured Delhi from the Rohilla Afghans. Mahadji
                Scindia, the commander of Maratha army, restored Shah Alam II to the throne.[23]

                In 1764, the Jat ruler of Bharatpur, Maharaja Jawahar Singh (the son of Maharaja Suraj Mal) attacked
                Delhi and captured the Red Fort of Delhi on 5 February 1765.[24] Two days later, after taking tribute
                from the Mughals, removed their armies from the fort and the Jats took away the throne of the Mughals,
                called the pride of the Mughals, and the doors of the Red Fort as a memorial, and this throne is today
                enhancing the beauty of the palaces of Deeg. The doors are located in the Lohagarh Fort of
                Bharatpur.[25]
