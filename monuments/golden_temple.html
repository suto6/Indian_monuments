                The Golden Temple (also known as the Harmandir Sahib (lit. 'House of God', Punjabi pronunciation:
                [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]), or the Darbār Sahib, (lit. ''exalted court'', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ] or
                Suvaran Mandir[2]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[3][4] It is the
                pre-eminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara
                Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.[3][5]

                The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in
                1577.[6][7] In 1604, Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the Golden
                Temple and was a prominent figure in its development.[3][8] The gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the
                Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading
                Afghan armies.[3][5][9] Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and
                copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden
                Temple.[10][11][12]

                The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh
                Sabha Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the
                early 1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical
                movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.[13] In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian
                Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to deaths of more than 1,000 soldiers, militants and
                civilians, as well as causing much damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of Akal Takht. The
                gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.[5]

                The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths.[3] It
                has a square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. The four entrances
                to the gurudwara symbolises the Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people are welcome
                into their holy place.[14] The complex is a collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool.[3]
                One of these is Akal Takht, the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism.[5] Additional buildings
                include a clock tower, the offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh
                community-run kitchen that offers a vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination.[5] Over
                150,000 people visit the holy shrine everyday for worship.[15] The Gurdwara complex has been nominated
                as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.[16]
