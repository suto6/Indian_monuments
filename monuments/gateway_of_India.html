                The Gateway of India is an arch-monument completed in 1924 on the waterfront of Mumbai (Bombay), India.
                It was erected to commemorate the landing of George V for his coronation as the Emperor of India in
                December 1911 at Strand Road near Wellington Fountain. He was the first British monarch to visit India.

                The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by
                elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George
                Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial
                arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a
                triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.

                After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important
                government personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left in 1948,
                following Indian independence a year earlier. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the
                Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. Today, the monument is synonymous with
                the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot
                for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local
                Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah,
                since 2003. There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry
                operations.

                The Gateway was the site of a terror attack in August 2003, when there was a bomb blast in a taxi parked
                in front of it. Access to the gateway was restricted after people congregated at its premises following
                the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which the Taj Hotel opposite the gateway and other locations in its
                vicinity were targeted.

                In March 2019, the Maharashtra state government proposed a four-step plan to develop the location for
                the convenience of tourists, following a direction issued by the state governor in February 2019.
                <br>

                The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the arrival of George V, Emperor of India and Mary of
                Teck, Empress consort, in India at Apollo Bunder, Mumbai (Bombay) on 2 December 1911 prior to the Delhi
                Durbar of 1911; it was the first visit of a British monarch to India.[2][3][4] However, they only got to
                see a cardboard model of the monument,[B] as construction did not begin until 1915.[2][6]

                The foundation stone for the Gateway was laid on 31 March 1913 by then Governor of Bombay, Sir George
                Sydenham Clarke with the final design of George Wittet for the Gateway sanctioned in August 1914.[7][6]
                Before the Gateway's construction, Apollo Bunder used to serve a native fishing ground.[8] Between 1915
                and 1919 work continued at the Apollo Bunder to reclaim the land on which the Gateway was to be built,
                along with the construction of a sea wall.[7] Gammon India had undertaken construction work for the
                gateway.[9][C]
                <br>
                <br>
                ts foundations were completed in 1920 while construction was finished in 1924.[12][7] The Gateway was
                opened to the public on 4 December 1924 by then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading.[13]
                Following Indian independence, the last British troops to leave India, the First Battalion of the
                Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the Gateway with a 21-gun salute, as part of a ceremony on 28
                February 1948, signalling the end of the British Raj.[14][15][D]

                N. Kamala, professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University,[16] refers to the Gateway as a "jewel in the crown"
                and a "symbol of conquest and colonisation".[17][E] The monument commemorates the legacy of British
                colonial rule, namely the first visit of a British monarch to India and its use as an entry point for
                prominent colonial personnel into British India.[20] Today the Gateway is synonymous with the city of
                Mumbai.[21][22][F] Since its construction, the gateway has remained amongst the first structures visible
                to visitors arriving in Bombay by the sea.[25][H]

                The structure, in yellow basalt and concrete, is rectangular, with two long sides and two much shorter
                ones. Three arched passageways run between the long sides, as well as a single arched passageway between
                the two shorter sides. The central arch is higher and wider, with an extra storey above, from which four
                turrets rise. The arches on the short sides are the same size and design as the smaller arches on the
                long sides. The style of the Gateway of India is Indo-Saracenic architecture, with many details taken
                from the Gujarati regional style. The façade is reminiscent of Gujarati mosque façades, for example the
                Jama Mosque, Ahmedabad of 1424, while the basic shape is, in the terminology of classical architecture,
                an octopylon with a floor plan of eight piers, as used in some triumphal arches and memorials, including
                the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris. The exterior features restrained but intricate bands of
                ornament, and jali screens around the smaller arches.
