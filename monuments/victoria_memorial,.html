                The Victoria Memorial is a large marble monument on the Maidan in Central Kolkata, having its entrance
                on the Queen's Way. It was built between 1906 and 1921 by the Government of India. It is dedicated to
                the memory of Queen Victoria, the Empress of India from 1876 to 1901
                <br>
                <br>
                t is the largest monument to a monarch anywhere in the world. It stands at 64 acres of gardens and is
                now a museum under the control of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.[1] Possessing prominent
                features of the Indo-Saracenic architecture, it has evolved into one of the most popular attractions in
                the city.

                According to historian Durba Ghosh, Viceroy of India Lord Curzon's "plans for the history museum that
                became the Victoria Memorial Hall predated Victoria's death in 1901. When he addressed a group at the
                Asiatic Society, he admitted that he had always planned to build such a historical museum. The queen's
                death had provided an appropriate occasion to monumentalize the empire."[2]

                After Victoria's death on 22 January 1901, Curzon wrote to Lord George Hamilton, the Secretary of State
                for India on 24 January, noting the "importance of Victoria's matriarchy to promoting loyalist
                feeling."[3] He proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.[4] Curzon said
                on 26 February 1901 in his address to the Asiatic Society,
                <br>
                <br>
                The government officials, princes, politicians, and people of India responded generously to Lord
                Curzon's appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument, amounting to one crore,
                five lakhs of Rupees, was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions.[6][5]

                The site chosen was near the present-day Raj Bhavan, known at the time as Government House. The
                construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905, with a
                subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project. There was also some uncertainty about the strength
                of the foundations, and tests on them were carried out.[7] On 4 January 1906, George, the Prince of
                Wales laid the foundation stone.[8]
                <br>
                <br>
                The architect of the Victoria Memorial was William Emerson (1843–1924).[11][12] The design is in the
                Indo-Saracenic style, mixing British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, and Deccani
                architectural influences.[13] The building is 338 by 228 feet (103 by 69 m) and rises to a height of 184
                feet (56 m). It is constructed of white Makrana marble.[14] Curzon deliberately intended the central
                chamber to be sixty-four feet in diameter in order to be slightly larger than the Taj Mahal. In design
                it echoes the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal-domed chattris, high portals,
                terrace, and domed corner towers. He also suggested that on the walls might be inscribed in golden
                letters Victoria’s proclamation of 1858. Around the interior walls of the rotunda of the memorial are a
                series of twelve canvas lunettes by Frank Salisbury celebrating key moments in Victoria’s life, such as
                her first Privy Council — moments already mythologized in countless other biographies, prints, and
                paintings.[3]

                The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's
                assistant, Vincent Jerome Esch, designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates. In 1902,
                Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial..
