                The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in
                December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like
                all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other
                qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of
                three to form nine sides,[1] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over
                34 metres[1] and a capacity of 1,300 people.[2] The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural
                awards[3][4] and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.[5]

                The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla,
                California,[6] after spending some years in Canada.[7] He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus
                Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design was undertaken by the British firm
                Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months,[8] and the construction was done by ECC Construction Group
                of Larsen & Toubro Limited[9][dead link] at a cost of $10.56 million.[10][11] The major part of the
                funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose
                will stipulated that his entire life savings would go towards the building of the temple.[12][page
                needed] A portion of the construction budget was saved and used to build a greenhouse to study
                indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.[13]

                Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October 1977 and dedicated the
                temple on 24 December 1986.[14] For the dedication, there was a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107
                countries, including some 4,000 Baháʼís from 22 states in India. The temple was opened to the public on
                1 January 1987 and more than 10,000 people visited that day.[15]

                The Baháʼí Faith teaches that a Baháʼí House of Worship should be a space for people of all religions to
                gather, reflect, and worship.[16] Anyone may enter the Lotus Temple irrespective of religious
                background, gender, or other distinctions, as is the case with all Baháʼí Houses of Worship.[16] The
                sacred writings of not only the Baháʼí Faith but also other religions can be read and/or chanted,
                regardless of language;[16] on the other hand, reading nonscriptural texts is forbidden, as is
                delivering sermons or lectures, or fundraising. Musical renditions of readings and prayers can be sung
                by choirs, but no musical instruments can be played inside. There is no set pattern for worship
                services, and ritualistic ceremonies are not permitted.[16]

                All Baháʼí Houses of Worship, including the Lotus Temple, share certain architectural elements, some of
                which are specified by Baháʼí scripture. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote
                that Baháʼí Houses of Worship must be nine-sided and circular.[16] While all current Baháʼí Houses of
                Worship have a dome, this is not regarded as an essential part of their architecture.[14] The Baháʼí
                scripture also states that no pictures, statues or images may be displayed within the House of Worship,
                and no pulpits or altars may be incorporated as an architectural feature (readers may stand behind
                simple portable lecture stands).[16]

                The design for the House of Worship in New Delhi is inspired by the lotus flower and is composed of 27
                free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides.[17] The temple's
                shape has symbolic and inter-religious significance because the lotus is often associated with purity,
                sacredness, spirituality, and knowledge. It has a spiritual significance in India.[3] The nine doors of
                the Lotus Temple open onto a central hall 34.3 metres tall[1] that can seat 1,300 people[18] and hold up
                to 2,500 people.[2] The temple has a diameter of 70 m.[19] The surface of the House of Worship is made
                of white marble from Penteli mountain in Greece, the same marble used in the construction of many
                ancient monuments (including the Parthenon[18]) and other Baháʼí buildings.[20] Along with its nine
                surrounding ponds and gardens, the Lotus Temple property comprises 26 acres (105,000 m2; 10.5 ha).[4] An
                educational centre beside the temple was established in 2017.[21]
