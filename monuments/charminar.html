                The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed
                in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of
                Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more
                than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular
                and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist
                attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as
                Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

                The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to
                the southwest lies the richly ornamented Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and
                architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of
                India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar or meenar,
                translating to "Four Pillars"; the towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand
                arches.[6]

                The fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, built the Charminar in 1591 after
                shifting his capital from Golconda to the newly formed city of Hyderabad.

                The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the current caretaker of the structure, mentions in its
                records, "There are various theories regarding the purpose for which Charminar was constructed. However,
                it is widely accepted that Charminar was built at the centre of the city, to commemorate the eradication
                of plague", a deadly disease which was wide spread at that time.[8][9] According to Jean de Thévenot, a
                French traveller of the 17th century whose narration was complemented with the available Persian texts,
                the Charminar was constructed in the year 1591 CE, to commemorate the beginning of the second Islamic
                millennium year (1000 AH). The event was celebrated far and wide in the Islamic world, thus Qutb Shah
                founded the city of Hyderabad to celebrate the event and commemorate it with the construction of this
                building.[10][11]: 17–19 
                <br>
                <br>
                The construction began in 1589 and was completed in two years with a cost of Rs. 9 lakhs, which was
                around 2 lakh huns/gold coins in those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of
                30 feet deep foundation. In 1670, a minaret had fallen down after being struck by lightning. It was then
                repaired at a cost of around Rs. 58000. In 1820, some part of it was renovated by Sikandar Jah at a cost
                of Rs. 2 lakh.

                The Charminar was constructed at the intersection of the historical trade route that connects the city
                to international markets through the port city of Machilipatnam.[12]: 195  The Old City of Hyderabad was
                designed with Charminar as its centrepiece.[13] The city was spread around the Charminar in four
                different quadrants and chambers, segregated according to the established settlements. Towards the north
                of Charminar is the Char Kaman, or four gateways, constructed in the cardinal
                direction.[10][12][14][15]: 170  Additional eminent architects from Persia were also invited to develop
                the city plan. The structure itself was intended to serve as a mosque and madrasa. It is of Indo-Islamic
                architecture style, incorporating Persian architectural elements. A sample of Charminar is said to have
                been created at Dabirpura/Nagaboli graveyard before the actual construction.

                Historian Masud Hussain Khan says that the construction of Charminar was completed in the year 1592, and
                that it is the city of Hyderabad which was actually founded in the year 1591.[16]: 4  According to the
                book "Days of the Beloved", Qutb shah constructed the Charminar in the year 1589, on the very spot where
                he first glimpsed his future queen Bhagmati, and after her conversion to Islam, Qutb Shah renamed the
                city as "Hyderabad". Though the story was rejected by the historians and scholars, it became popular
                folklore among the locals.[17]: 3, 12 

                Qutb Shah was also among the early poets of Dakhani Urdu. While laying the foundation of Charminar, he
                performed the prayers in Dakhini
                <br>

                Mughal rule
                Charminar was later captured and became an icon of Mughal Empire, the Asaf Jah I was the custodian of
                the famous structure.

                80,000 Sepoy units loyal to the Mughal Empire lived within the "garrison of the Charminar" and often
                viewed it as a sister of the Taj Mahal.

                Hyderabad State
                Charminar was ruled by the princely state known as the Nizam of Hyderabad.
