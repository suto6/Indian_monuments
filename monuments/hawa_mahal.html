                The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. Built from red and pink sandstone,
                it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai
                Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the
                unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.

                It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small
                windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice
                design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below
                without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass
                through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many
                people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the
                back.[5]

                In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to
                the monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568 million.[6] The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve
                the historical monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it.[7]
                The palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, and arched
                roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has delicately modelled
                hanging cornices.

                This palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). The top three
                floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios
                in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small
                portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives
                the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique façade. The inner face
                on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal
                ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described as "having
                rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding; while fountains adorn the
                centre of the courtyard".[8][9]

                Lal Chand Ustad was the architect. Built-in red and pink coloured sandstone, in keeping with the décor
                of the other monuments in the city, its colour is a full testimony to the epithet of "Pink City" given
                to Jaipur. Its façade with 953 niches with intricately carved jharokhas (some are made of wood) is a
                stark contrast to the plain-looking rear side of the structure. Its cultural and architectural heritage
                is a reflection of a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and Islamic Mughal architecture; the Rajput
                style is seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted pillars, lotus, and floral patterns, and the Islamic
                style as evident in its stone inlay filigree work and arches (as distinguished from its similarity with
                the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri).[10]

                The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens into a large
                courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the
                east side. An archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard.[11]

                Hawa Mahal was also known as the chef-d'œuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh as it was his favourite resort
                because of the elegance and built-in interior of the Mahal. The cooling effect in the chambers, provided
                by the breeze passing through the small windows of the façade, was enhanced by the fountains provided at
                the centre of each of the chambers.[12]
